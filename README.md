# Robot Simulator

This Project is a Robot Toy simulation on a Table, responding to the commands, the Toy will move around the table in any direction one step at a time. It can also switch directions staying in the current coordinates.

## Getting Started

The script is built in Python 3, I've been learning python recently and i picked this project in python to gain more confidence and self assess my though process and approcing the problem solving in Python it was greatly helping me throughout the time i spent on this projct- It can be checkedout and run in any online or standalone python Runtime env.

### Prerequisites

Python 3 in any Machine will do.

### Installing

  1. download or checkout robo-toy-v01.py
  2. ensure you have Python 3 compiler and IDE if required , any text editor with python language plugin will be good enough.
  3. I used online editor for this project.

## Running the tests

1. Initial Screen result (after running the Python) 

![ERROR](0.%20Initial%20Screen%20result.PNG?raw=true "initial screen")

2. Place Move and Report Scenario :
![ERROR](1.%20Place%20Command%20Scenario%201.PNG?raw=true "Place scenario 1")

3. Place , Rotate the Toy and Report Scenario :
![ERROR](2.%20Place%20Command%20Scenario%202.PNG?raw=true "Place scenario 2")

4. Place , Rotate , Move the Toy & Report Scenario :
![ERROR](3.%20Place%20Command%20Scenario%203.png?raw=true "Place scenario 3")

5. Some Sample Error Messages :
